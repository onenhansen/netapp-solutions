== Executive summary

A growing number of organizations are leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications and large language models (LLMs) to interpret user prompts and generate responses to increase productivity and business value. These prompts and responses can include text, code, images, or even therapeutic protein structures retrieved from an organization’s internal knowledge base, data lakes, code repositories, and document repositories. This paper covers the reference design of the NetApp® AIPod™ Mini solution, comprising NetApp AFF storage and servers with Intel® Xeon® 6 processors. It includes NetApp ONTAP® data management software combined with Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX), and Intel® AI for Enterprise Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) software built on Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA). The NetApp AIPod Mini for enterprise RAG enables organizations to augment a public LLM into a private generative AI (GenAI) inferencing solution. The solution demonstrates efficient and cost-effective RAG inferencing at enterprise scale, designed to enhance reliability and provide you with better control over your proprietary information.

== Intel storage partner validation

Servers powered by Intel Xeon 6 processors are built to handle demanding AI inferencing workloads, using Intel AMX for maximum performance. To enable optimal storage performance and scalability, the solution has been successfully validated using NetApp ONTAP, enabling enterprises to meet the needs of RAG applications. This validation was conducted on servers featuring Intel Xeon 6 processors. Intel and NetApp have a strong partnership focused on delivering AI solutions that are optimized, scalable, and aligned with customer business requirements.

== Advantages of running RAG systems with NetApp

RAG applications involve retrieval of knowledge from companies’ document repositories in various types such as PDF, text, CSV, Excel, or knowledge graphs. This data is normally stored in solutions such as an S3 object storage or NFS on-premises as the source for data. NetApp has been a leader in data management, data mobility, data governance, and data security technologies across the ecosystem of edge, data center, and cloud. NetApp ONTAP data management provides enterprise-grade storage to support various types of AI workloads, including batch and real-time inferencing, and offers some of the following benefits: 

•	Velocity and scalability. You can handle large datasets at high velocity for versioning with the ability to scale performance and capacity independently.
•	Data access. Multiprotocol support allows client applications to read data using S3, NFS, and SMB file-sharing protocols. ONTAP S3 NAS buckets can facilitate data access in multimodal LLM inference scenarios.
•	Reliability and confidentiality. ONTAP provides data protection, built-in NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP), and dynamic provisioning of storage, and it offers both software- and hardware-based encryption to enhance confidentiality and security. ONTAP is compliant with FIPS 140-2 for all SSL connections.

== Target audience
This document is intended for AI decision makers, data engineers, business leaders, and departmental executives who want to take advantage of an infrastructure built to deliver enterprise RAG and GenAI solutions. Prior knowledge of AI inferencing, LLMs, Kubernetes, and networking and its components will help during the implementation phase.

== Technology Requirements
=== Hardware 
==== Intel AI technologies
With Xeon 6 as a host CPU, accelerated systems benefit from high single-thread performance; higher memory bandwidth; improved reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS); and more I/O lanes. Intel AMX accelerates inferencing for INT8 and BF16 and offers support for FP16-trained models, with up to 2,048 floating-point operations per cycle per core for INT8 and 1,024 floating-point operations per cycle per core for BF16/FP16. To deploy a RAG solution using Xeon 6 processors, a minimum RAM of 250GB and 500GB disk space is generally recommended. However, this is highly dependent on the LLM model size. For more information, refer to the Intel https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2024-05/intel-xeon-6-product-brief.pdf[Xeon 6 processor^] product brief.

=== Deployment steps
==== Deploy ONTAP storage appliance 
Deploy and provision your NetApp ONTAP storage appliance. Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-family/[ONTAP hardware systems documentation^] for details.

==== Configure an ONTAP SVM for NFS and S3 access 
Configure an ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM) for NFS and S3 access on a network that is accessible by your Kubernetes nodes. 

To create an SVM using ONTAP System Manager, navigate to Storage > Storage VMs, and click the + Add button. When enabling S3 access for your SVM, choose the option to use an external-CA (certificate authority) signed certificate, not a system-generated certificate. You can use either a self-signed certificate or a certificate that is signed by a publicly trusted CA. For additional details, refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/index.html[ONTAP documentation.^]

The following screenshot depicts the creation of an SVM using ONTAP System Manager. Modify details as needed based on your environment.

Figure 4 - SVM creation using ONTAP System Manager.
image:aipod-mini-image05.png[600,600]
image:aipod-mini-image06.png[600,600]

==== Configure S3 permissions
Configure S3 user/group settings for the SVM that you created in the previous step. Make sure you have a user with full access to all S3 API operations for that SVM. Refer to the ONTAP S3 documentation for details. 

Note:	This user will be needed for the Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application’s data ingest service. 
If you created your SVM using ONTAP System Manager, System Manager will have automatically created a user named `sm_s3_user` and a policy named `FullAccess` when you created your SVM, but no permissions will have been assigned to `sm_s3_user`. 

To edit permissions for this user, navigate to Storage > Storage VMs, click the name of the SVM that you created in the previous step, click Settings, and then click the pencil icon next to “S3.” To give `sm_s3_user` full access to all S3 API operations, create a new group that associates `sm_s3_user` with the `FullAccess` policy as depicted in the following screenshot.

Figure 5 - S3 permissions.

image:aipod-mini-image07.png[600,600]

==== Create an S3 bucket
Create an S3 bucket within the SVM that you created previously. 
To create an SVM using ONTAP System Manager, navigate to Storage > Buckets, and click the + Add button. For additional details, refer to the ONTAP S3 documentation. 

The following screenshot depicts the creation of an S3 bucket using ONTAP System Manager. 

Figure 6 - Create an S3 bucket.
image:aipod-mini-image08.png[600,600]

==== Configure S3 bucket permissions
Configure permissions for the S3 bucket that you created in the previous step. Ensure that the user you configured in a prior step has the following permissions: `GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject, ListBucket, GetBucketAcl, GetObjectAcl, ListBucketMultipartUploads, ListMultipartUploadParts, GetObjectTagging, PutObjectTagging, DeleteObjectTagging, GetBucketLocation, GetBucketVersioning, PutBucketVersioning, ListBucketVersions, GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, DeleteBucketPolicy, PutLifecycleConfiguration, GetLifecycleConfiguration, GetBucketCORS, PutBucketCORS.`

To edit S3 bucket permissions using ONTAP System Manager, navigate to Storage > Buckets, click the name of your bucket, click Permissions, and then click Edit. Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/object-storage-management/index.html[ONTAP S3 documentation^] for additional details.

The following screenshot depicts the necessary bucket permissions in ONTAP System Manager.

Figure 7 - S3 bucket permissions.
image:aipod-mini-image09.png[600,600]

==== Create bucket cross-origin resource sharing rule
Using the ONTAP CLI, create a bucket cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) rule for the bucket that you created in a previous step:
[source,cli]
----
ontap::> bucket cors-rule create -vserver erag -bucket erag-data -allowed-origins *erag.com -allowed-methods GET,HEAD,PUT,DELETE,POST -allowed-headers *
----
This rule allows OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG web application to interact with the bucket from within a web browser.

==== Deploy servers
Deploy your servers and install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on every server. 
After Ubuntu is installed, install the NFS utilities on every server. To install the NFS utilities, run the following command:
[source,cli]
----
 apt-get update && apt-get install nfs-common
----
==== Install Kubernetes
Install Kubernetes on your servers using Kubespray. Refer to the https://kubespray.io/[Kubespray documentation^] for details.

==== Install Trident CSI driver
Install the NetApp Trident CSI driver in your Kubernetes cluster. Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html[Trident installation documentation^] for details.

==== Create a Trident back end
Create a Trident back end for the SVM that you created previously. When creating your back end, use the `ontap-nas` driver. Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/ontap-nas.html[Trident back-end documentation^] for details.

==== Create a storage class
Create a Kubernetes storage class corresponding to the Trident back end that you created in the previous step. Refer to the Trident storage class documentation for details.

==== OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG
Install OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG in your Kubernetes cluster. Refer to the https://github.com/opea-project/Enterprise-RAG/blob/release-1.2.0/deployment/README.md[Intel AI for Enterprise RAG deployment^] documentation for details. Be sure to take note of the required configuration file modifications that are described later in this paper. You must make these modifications before executing the installation playbook in order for the Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application to work correctly with your ONTAP storage system.

=== Enable use of ONTAP S3
When installing OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG, edit your main configuration file to enable use of ONTAP S3 as your source data repository.

To enable use of ONTAP S3, set the following values within the `edp` section.

Note:	By default, the Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application ingests data from all existing buckets in your SVM. If you have multiple buckets in your SVM, you can modify the `bucketNameRegexFilter` field so that data is ingested only from certain buckets.
[source,cli]
----
edp:
  enabled: true
  namespace: edp
  dpGuard:
    enabled: false
  storageType: s3compatible
  s3compatible:
    region: "us-east-1"
    accessKeyId: "<your_access_key>"
    secretAccessKey: "<your_secret_key>"
    internalUrl: "https://<your_ONTAP_S3_interface>"
    externalUrl: "https://<your_ONTAP_S3_interface>"
    bucketNameRegexFilter: ".*"
----
=== Configure scheduled synchronization settings
When installing the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application, enable `scheduledSync` so that the application automatically ingests new or updated files from your S3 buckets.

When `scheduledSync` is enabled, the application automatically checks your source S3 buckets for new or updated files. Any new or updated files that are found as part of this synchronization process are automatically ingested and added to the RAG knowledge base. The application checks your source buckets based on a preset time interval. The default time interval is 60 seconds, meaning that the application checks for changes every 60 seconds. You might want to change this interval to suit your specific needs.

To enable `scheduledSync` and set the synchronization interval, set the following values in `deployment/components/edp/values.yaml:`
[source,cli]
----
celery:
  config:
    scheduledSync:
      enabled: true
      syncPeriodSeconds: "60"
----
=== Change volume access modes
In `deployment/components/gmc/microservices-connector/helm/values.yaml`, for each volume in the `pvc` list, change the `accessMode` to `ReadWriteMany`.
[source,cli]
----
pvc:
  modelLlm:
    name: model-volume-llm
    accessMode: ReadWriteMany
    storage: 100Gi
  modelEmbedding:
    name: model-volume-embedding
    accessMode: ReadWriteMany
    storage: 20Gi
  modelReranker:
    name: model-volume-reranker
    accessMode: ReadWriteMany
    storage: 10Gi
  vectorStore:
    name: vector-store-data
    accessMode: ReadWriteMany
    storage: 20Gi
----

=== (Optional) Disable SSL certificate verification
If you used a self-signed certificate when enabling S3 access for your SVM, you must disable SSL certificate verification. If you used a certificate that is signed by a publicly trusted CA, you can skip this step.

To disable SSL certificate verification, set the following values in `deployment/components/edp/values.yaml:`

[source,cli]
----
edpExternalUrl: "https://s3.erag.com"
edpExternalSecure: "true"
edpExternalCertVerify: "false"
edpInternalUrl: "edp-minio:9000"
edpInternalSecure: "true"
edpInternalCertVerify: "false"
----

==== Access OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI
Access the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI. Refer to the https://github.com/opea-project/Enterprise-RAG/blob/release-1.1.2/deployment/README.md#interact-with-chatqna[Intel AI for Enterprise RAG deployment documentation^] for details.

Figure 8 - OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI.
image:aipod-mini-image10.png[600,600]


==== Ingest data for RAG
You can now ingest files for inclusion in RAG-based query augmentation. There are multiple options for ingesting files. Choose the appropriate option for your needs.

Note:	After a file has been ingested, the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application automatically checks for updates to the file and ingests the updates accordingly.

*Option 1: Upload directly to your S3 bucket
To ingest many files at once, we recommend uploading the files to your S3 bucket (the bucket that you created earlier) by using the S3 client of your choice. Popular S3 clients include the AWS CLI, the Amazon SDK for Python (Boto3), s3cmd, S3 Browser, Cyberduck, and Commander One. If the files are of a supported type, any files that you upload to your S3 bucket will be automatically ingested by the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application. 

Note:	At the time of this writing, the following file types are supported: PDF, HTML, TXT, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, MD, XML, JSON, JSONL, YAML, XLS, XLSX, CSV, TIFF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, and SVG. 

You can use the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI to confirm that your files were properly ingested. Refer to the Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI documentation for details. Note that it can take some time for the application to ingest a large number of files.

*Option 2: Upload using the UI
If you need to ingest only a small number of files, you can ingest them using the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI. Refer to the Intel AI for Enterprise RAG UI documentation for details.

Figure 9 - Data ingest UI.
image:aipod-mini-image11.png[600,600]

==== Execute chat queries
You can now “chat” with the OPEA for Intel AI for Enterprise RAG application by using the included chat UI. When responding to your queries, the application performs RAG using your ingested files. This means that the application automatically searches for relevant information within your ingested files and incorporates this information when responding to your queries.

== Sizing guidance
As part of our validation effort, we conducted performance testing in coordination with Intel. This testing resulted in the sizing guidance outlined in the following table.

.Sizing guidance

|Llama-8B, Llama-13B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 14B, DeepSeek Distill 8B

|Input size
|~2k tokens
|~4 pages

|Output size
|~2k tokens
|~4 pages

|Concurrent users
|32
|“Concurrent users” refers to prompt requests that are submitting queries at the same time.
|===

_Note: The sizing guidance presented above is based on performance validation and test results gathered by using Intel Xeon 6 processors with 96 cores. For customers with similar I/O tokens and model size requirements we recommend using servers with Xeon 6 processors with 96 or 128 cores._

== Conclusion
Enterprise RAG systems and LLMs are technologies that work together to help organizations provide accurate and context-aware responses. These responses involve information retrieval based on a vast collection of private and internal enterprise data. By using RAG, APIs, vector embeddings, and high-performance storage systems to query document repositories that contain company data, the data is processed faster and securely. The NetApp AIPod Mini combines NetApp’s intelligent data infrastructure with ONTAP data management capabilities and Intel Xeon 6 processors, Intel AI for Enterprise RAG, and the OPEA software stack to help deploy high-performance RAG applications and put organizations on the path to AI leadership.
